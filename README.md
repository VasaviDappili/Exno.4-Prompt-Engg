### DATE:10-05-2025                                                                           
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212223040030
### Developed by: DAPPILI VASAVI

### Aim:
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

## Algorithm: 
## 1. Direct Instruction Prompting
## Objective: Guide the chatbot to respond concisely to customer inquiries.
## Prompt Pattern:
## Prompt:

"When a customer asks for the status of their order, reply with:
'Your order is currently being processed and will be delivered by [date].'"
## Use Case:
For quick and clear responses to common queries such as order status, refund confirmation, or operating hours.

## 2. Contextual Prompting
## Objective: Incorporate specific context to provide detailed answers based on the user‚Äôs previous interaction.
## Prompt Pattern:
## Prompt:

"If the customer previously mentioned that they haven‚Äôt received their order, say:
'I see that you mentioned your order hasn't arrived yet. Let me check the details for you and get back shortly.'"
## Use Case:
Useful for multi-turn conversations where the chatbot must remember and reference earlier parts of the chat to maintain coherence.

## 3. Persona-Based Prompting
## Objective: Design the chatbot to adopt a specific persona, making the interaction more engaging.
## Prompt Pattern:
## Prompt:

"Pretend you are a friendly, helpful customer service representative. Use a conversational tone, such as:
'Hey there! I‚Äôm here to help with any questions you might have. Let‚Äôs get your issue sorted!'"
## Use Case:
Best for enhancing customer experience by making the bot feel more human-like, on-brand, and approachable.

## 4. Few-Shot Prompting
## Objective: Teach the AI how to respond using a few examples, enabling it to generalize for similar situations.
## Prompt Pattern:
## Prompt:

"Here are some examples of how to handle technical questions:
'My phone isn't charging.' ‚Üí 'Have you tried using a different cable? If that doesn‚Äôt work, it may be an issue with the port.'
'The screen is flickering.' ‚Üí 'It sounds like a display issue. Have you tried restarting the device?'
Now, respond to: 'My app keeps crashing.'"
## Use Case:
Ideal for training the chatbot on how to respond to less common or varied support requests with appropriate tone and content.

## 5. Chain of Thought Prompting
## Objective: Use a step-by-step reasoning approach for resolving more complex or technical issues.
## Prompt Pattern:
## Prompt:

"When a customer reports their laptop overheating, guide them through the following steps:
Ask if they are using the laptop on a soft surface.
Suggest moving the laptop to a flat, hard surface for better airflow.
Ask if they‚Äôve cleaned the vents recently.
Recommend restarting the device to see if the issue persists.
Now, solve: 'My laptop fan is making a loud noise.'"
## Use Case:
Helpful in tech support scenarios where the problem-solving process involves logical sequencing and troubleshooting.

## 6. Instruction with Constraints
## Objective: Instruct the chatbot to provide assistance while adhering to specific constraints (e.g., response length or tone).
## Prompt Pattern:
## Prompt:

"Respond to order inquiries in no more than 50 words and avoid using technical jargon.
For example: 'Your order is on the way and should arrive by [date]. Feel free to reach out if you need anything else.'"
## Use Case:
Useful when the chatbot must respond within tight UX or brand guidelines‚Äîsuch as character limits, simplicity for non-tech users, or specific voice guidelines.

## 7. Reflective Prompting
## Objective: Ensure that the chatbot reflects the user‚Äôs query back to them before providing a response, reducing misunderstandings.
## Prompt Pattern:
## Prompt:

"When a customer asks for help, first reflect their question back to them.
For example, if they ask 'How can I reset my password?' respond with:
'You're asking how to reset your password, correct? Here‚Äôs how you can do it.'"
## Use Case:
Best used in sensitive or high-stakes conversations (e.g., billing, account access), where confirming intent avoids errors or miscommunication.

## Algorithm:
## STEP 1: Define the Use Case

Goal: Help users schedule or manage medical appointments.

Target: Patients interacting via a hospital website or mobile app.

## STEP 2: Select Suitable Prompting Techniques

Based on complexity, context sensitivity, and emotional tone.

## STEP 3: Design Prompt Templates

Use appropriate language structure, tone, and sample interactions.

## STEP 4: Implement Prompt-Driven Responses

Feed prompts into a language model to simulate chatbot dialogue.

## STEP 5: Test and Evaluate

Compare outputs from different techniques.

Validate accuracy, tone, and contextual understanding.
